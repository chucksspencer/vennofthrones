# venn-of-thrones
This was an excuse to play with Vue. It's a very simple single page application that uses the [The Movie DB's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to search for cast members overlap between Game of Thrones and other movies and TV shows. It uses the [D3 graphing library](https://d3js.org/) to render a venn diagram of the results. It's hosted at https://www.vennofthrones.com/.

I barely scratched the surface of Vue with this, really, but I learned some stuff.
